## Web3 In Metaverse Introductory guide


> What is web3?

Before we define the web3 stack, let’s attempt to define web3. There are countless definitions depending on who you ask, but to me I find this definition spot on:


Web3 is the stack of protocols that enable fully decentralized applications.

With this decentralized tech stack, we can begin building out decentralized applications which have their own set implications and characteristics.

Some of the characteristics enabled by web3 are:

- Decentralized web infrastructure
- Ownership (of data, content, and platform)
- Native digital payments
- Self-sovereign identity
- Distributed, trust-less, & robust infrastructure
- Open, public, composable back ends


While some of the applications built on decentralized tech stacks will replace their predecessors, a new paradigm of apps have also been made possible by the new primitives enabled by blockchains.

Native digital payments and public back end infrastructure – like machine learning, mobile devices, virtual reality, and other technological primitives, platforms, and building blocks – enable entirely new types of applications to be built, some that have yet to be imagined.

Does this mean that everything is going to be replaced by web3? Not necessarily. While I do think that building on a decentralized tech stack is a much better choice for certain types of applications – like almost any technical decision, it depends on what you are building.
